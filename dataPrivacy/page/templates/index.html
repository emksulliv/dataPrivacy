                        <p>Media platforms allow for users to create media accounts where they can provide behavioral, preference, and demographic data about themselves. This data can be collected from the things you post, like, accept or search about through your devices. Big data companies and scientists then collect this data and build personas about you that can determine your age and gender, what you like and much more.</p>
                        <p>Essentially, big data companies are creating computer-based personalities based on information collected from your devices, that end up knowing more about you than your family and friends do.</p>

                        <p>To the highest bidder! No seriously. The collection and distribution of user data is sold by social media services to buyers who may be interested in using it.</p>
